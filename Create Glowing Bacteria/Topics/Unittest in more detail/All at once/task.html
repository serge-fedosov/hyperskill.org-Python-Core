<h2>All at once</h2>
<p>Let's imagine that you have several files with tests, but you only need to run some tests selectively. Write the text you need to type into the command-line to run the following tests<em><strong> in one run</strong></em>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the <code class="java">TestSomeUnit</code> test case tests from the file  <code class="java">test_one.py</code>; </li>
	<li>a test method called <code class="java">test_something()</code> from the <code class="java">TestAnotherUnit</code> test case from <code class="java">test_two.py</code>;</li>
</ul>

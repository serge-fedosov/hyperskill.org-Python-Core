<h2>Controlled iteration</h2>
<html><body><p>We have created the functions <code class="java">num</code>, <code class="java">double_num</code>, and <code class="java">square_num</code>. Each of these functions can take a range of numbers and print out a number, a doubled number, and a squared number, respectively. The problem is that they print them in blocks, five lines for each function, as shown below: </p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">The number is:  1
The number is:  2
The number is:  3
The number is:  4
The number is:  5
The double of the number is:  2
The double of the number is:  4
...
# and so on</code></pre>
<p>But we want each function to print out one iteration at a time. Like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">The number is:  1
The double of the number is:  2
The square of the number is:  1
The number is:  2
The double of the number is:  4
The square of the number is:  4
...
# and so on</code></pre>
<p>This can be accomplished with the help of the <code class="java">threading</code> module. Replace the dots in the program below by instantiating threads and starting them to achieve the desired output.</p></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>

<h2>Empty</h2>
<html><body><p>Remember that when using deque, we should control the length of the stack, otherwise an error will arise when it's empty. Let's practice this!</p>
<p>A stack in this task represents a bag with candies. In the beginning, you are given a variable <code class="java">candy_bag</code>. You don't know how many candies there are, but you can be asked to <samp>PUT</samp> or <samp>TAKE</samp> one candy at a time. Given a sequence of such actions, print out all candies that are taken from the bag. If there are no more candies, print <code class="java">"We are out of candies :("</code>.</p>
<p>The input will be as follows: first, there's the number <strong>n</strong> that shows the total number of actions. <samp>PUT candy_name</samp> denotes putting the corresponding candy into the bag, and TAKE means that we take a candy from the top of the stack.</p>
<p>If the initial stack contains only one candy, <samp>Daim</samp>, here's an example of what the input might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">7
TAKE
PUT Twix
TAKE
TAKE
TAKE
PUT Reesee's
TAKE</code></pre>
<p>And the corresponding output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Daim
Twix
We are out of candies :(
We are out of candies :(
Reesee's</code></pre></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>

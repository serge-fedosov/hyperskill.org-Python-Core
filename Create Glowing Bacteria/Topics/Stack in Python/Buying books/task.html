<h2>Buying books</h2>
<p>Alice is a book lover, she buys new books regularly. Unfortunately, she doesn't have much time to read them right away, and she always has a stack of unread books. When Alice brings a new book, she puts it on top of the unread ones. Whenever she feels like reading, she takes a book from the very top of her book stack, finishes it in one go, and puts it on the shelf with the books she has already read.</p>
<p>Given a sequence of Alice's actions, print out all books that she reads. Books should be printed on separate lines.</p>
<p>The input is as follows. The number <code class="java">n</code> refers to the total number of actions. <code class="java">BUY book_name</code> denotes buying a book called <code class="java">book_name</code>, while <code class="java">READ</code> refers to reading a book from the top of the stack.</p>
<p>You can assume that initially, Alice doesn't have any unread books.</p>
<p>Use <code class="java">split(" ", 1)</code> to split the input string on the first whitespace only. This way, the book title will not be split.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4<br>BUY Pride and Prejudice<br>BUY Anna Karenina<br>READ<br>BUY Hamlet<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Anna Karenina</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">8<br>BUY Pride and Prejudice<br>BUY Anna Karenina<br>READ<br>BUY Hamlet<br>BUY Pride and Prejudice<br>BUY Anna Karenina<br>READ<br>BUY Hamlet</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Anna Karenina<br>Anna Karenina</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>

<html><body><p>Max has Python 3.7 on his machine. He decided to start learning the <code class="language-python">pprint</code> library and its features. Right now, he is working with the following dictionary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">cars = [
    {
        "id": 234,
        "model": "Honda Civic",
        "color": "Black",
        "transmission": "Automatic",
        "doors": 4,
    },
    {
        "id": 783,
        "model": "BMW X5",
        "color": "Blue",
        "transmission": "Automatic",
        "doors": 2,
    }
]</code></pre>
<p>He wants to print using the <code class="language-python">pprint</code> library, and he ends up with the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">pprint(cars, indent=2, sort_dicts=False)</code></pre>
<p>What will be the output of his code?</p></body></html>

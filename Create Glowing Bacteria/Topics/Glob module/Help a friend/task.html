<h2>Help a friend</h2>
<html><body><p>Your friend is a language teacher that has the <code class="java">my_dir</code> directory with all kinds of files. Help him find all <code class="java">txt</code> files which have <code class="java">a1</code>, <code class="java">a2</code> or <code class="java">b1</code> in their names. Use the glob module for that and take a look at what your friend has written:</p>
<p><code class="java">glob.glob('my_dir\\*[a-c]1*.txt')</code></p>
<p>There's a mistake in this search. Which files does it return?</p></body></html>
